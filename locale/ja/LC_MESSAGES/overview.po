"The Gengo API allows you to connect your app to Gengo, and order human "
"translation without needing to use a manual web interface. Because human "
"translation is not instant, our API is asynchronous (a bit like `Mechanical "
"Turk <http://mturk.com>`__). This means that unlike some other web APIs like "
"`Flickr <http://flickr.com>`__ or `Twitter <http://twitter.com>`__, you need "
"to allow time for translators to complete their translations."
